# Virtual_world

### This was the final project of my first year in IIM.  

The goal was to build a website while acomplishing multiples objectives in different languages and with a coherent maketing and design approch. 
This website uses JS, PHP, CSS, and SQL.  
You can see all the objectives for this project in the pdf file.  
  
If you want to download it you will need to import the SQL file to create the database.
  
I am pretty proud of this project, as I've invest myselft into it and learned a lot by doing so.
